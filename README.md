Project Goal
---------------------

You are a junior data scientist on the Zillow data science team and recieve the following email in your inbox:

    We want to be able to predict the property tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties that had a transaction during 2017.

    We have a model already, but we are hoping your insights can help us improve it. I need recommendations on a way to make a better model. Maybe you will create a new feature out of existing ones that works better, try a non-linear regression algorithm, or try to create a different model for each county. Whatever you find that works (or doesn't work) will be useful. Given you have just joined our team, we are excited to see your outside perspective.

    One last thing, Zach lost the email that told us where these properties were located. Ugh, Zach :-/. Because property taxes are assessed at the county level, we would like to know what states and counties these are located in.

-- The Zillow Data Science Team



   - Construct an ML Regression model that predict propery tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties using attributes of the properties.

   - Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties. Some questions that come to mind are: Why do some properties have a much higher value than others when they are located so close to each other? Why are some properties valued so differently from others when they have nearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location? Is having 1 bathroom worse than having 2 bedrooms?

   - Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.

   - Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in prediction these homes' values.
